# Documenting my studies of C
## I'm using the book "The C Programming Language - ansi C"

### Day - one
I'm working on the first chapter. I have some experience progamming in other languages
but it's been a while since the last time I tried programming in C so I've decided to 
start from the begining of the book. After I get some experience I'll try to study the other 
book about pointers at this point I'll also start doing leetcode exercises.

Let's go!!!!!!
